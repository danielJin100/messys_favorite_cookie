
STEP 1: In a medium mixing bowl, combine flour, salt, and baking powder.

STEP 2: In a large mixing bowl combine softened butter and both sugars (photos 1-2). Mix until light and fluffy.

STEP 3: Add the vanilla extract and eggs. Mix until just combined (photos 3-4).

STEP 4: Add in the box of cheesecake pudding mix; mix well (photo 5).

STEP 5: Add in the dry ingredients into the moist ingredients (photo 6). Mix just until combined and a dough forms.

STEP 6: Fold in white chocolate chips (photo 7).

STEP 7: Chill dough for at least 30 minutes to an hour.

STEP 8: After dough is chilled preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare a cookie sheet with nonstick spray. Set a sheet of parchment paper for making the recipe (not in the baking sheet).

STEP 9: Using a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop, scoop out 2 tablespoons of dough and place on the parchment paper.

STEP 10: Using your hand or a spoon, flatten the dough.

STEP 11: Place about Â¼ cup of the raspberry preserves into a small Ziploc bag. Cut the tip off one the bottom corners to make a small hole. This creates a disposable piping bag.

STEP 12: Using the piping bag, pipe a few small circles of jam onto the cookie dough. Roll the dough into a ball and place on the baking sheet. Repeat until the dough is all used.

STEP 13: Bake for 9-11 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. For a crispier cookie, bake about 15 minutes. Cool on the cookie sheet for a few minutes then transfer to a cooling rack to fully cool.
